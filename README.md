# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using Create React App. The game can be played against a computer opponent or against another player.

Additionally, I implemented an impossible to win mode against a computer opponent, using the MiniMax algorithm.

I used the [Tic-Tac-Toe API](https://github.com/alkindi17/tictactoe-api) that I created, as the back-end of this project.
